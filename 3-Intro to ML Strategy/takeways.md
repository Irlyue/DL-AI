1. Use a single number evaluation metric.
   - (Precision, Recall) -> F1-score
   - (error1, error2,...) -> average error 
2. Make sure your dev and test set come from the same data distribution.
3. There are two basic steps to develop an ML application:
   1. Place your target: define your metric so you have something to aim at
   2. Try your best to hit the target: modified your formula of cost functions, tuning hyper-parameters, changing your dev/test data, and so on.
